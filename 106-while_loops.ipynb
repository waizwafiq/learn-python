                "1. **Basic Concepts:**\n",
                "   - A while loop executes code repeatedly as long as a condition is True\n",
                "   - It's particularly useful when you don't know the number of iterations in advance\n",
                "   - The condition is checked before each iteration\n",
                "\n",
                "2. **Control Flow:**\n",
                "   - `break` exits the loop completely\n",
                "   - `continue` skips to the next iteration\n",
                "   - `else` executes when the loop condition becomes False (not when `break` is used)\n",

                "3. **Common Patterns:**\n",
                "   - Counter-controlled loops (similar to for loops)\n",
                "   - Sentinel-controlled loops (stopping on a special value)\n",

                "4. **Best Practices:**\n",
                "   - Always ensure the loop condition will eventually become False\n",
                "   - Be careful with variable updates inside the loop\n",

                "5. **Applications:**\n",

                "3. **Explore advanced topics:** Look into recursion as an alternative to some while loop patterns\n",
