                "   - A while loop repeats code as long as a condition is True\n",
                "   - The condition is checked before each iteration\n",

                "2. **Control Flow:**\n",
                "   - `break` exits the loop immediately\n",
                "   - `continue` skips to the next iteration\n",

                "4. **Practical Applications:**\n",
